# BuildSphere — MVP Scaffold

This is an initial scaffold for BuildSphere (Next.js + TypeScript). It implements:

- Dark splash animation with `BuildSphere` logo
- Login / signup UI (mocked for MVP) that sets a local session
- A simple editor interface with a side panel and a "Projects" modal

Next steps: integrate Supabase Auth, real 3D viewport with `@react-three/fiber`, persistent project storage.

Run locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\AMAR\Web Project"
npm install
npm run dev
```
